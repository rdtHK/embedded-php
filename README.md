## TODO

- [ ] Maybe change render to return a string instead of printing directly?
    - [ ] Maybe both? render & print methods
- [ ] Cache
    - [ ] InMemoryCache
    - [ ] FilesystemCache
- [ ] Do something about %> inside strings
- [x] A way of extending templates
    Using $GLOBALS seems kinda ugly but I'm tired and lazy.
